# INFOMOV 2023/2024 Assignment 1 Template

### Setup
Clone the github repository using `git clone --recursive`, to make sure you get all the submodules.
<br>
If you are on windows, run the `bootstrap_windows.bat` file (this requires Visual Studio 17 2022 by default) and open the generated Visual Studio project located in the build/ folder. Make sure you set the build target to GAME and use Release mode.
<br>
If you are on Linux/Mac, run the `bootstrap_linux_mac.sh` (making sure you can run it using `chmod +x bootstrap_linux_mac.sh` file and then run `make` in the build/ folder. Make sure you can run the executable by running `chmod +x GAME` and then run the binary using `./GAME`.

### Notes
Has for now only been tested on Windows and Linux, but I am pretty confident it works on Mac as well.
